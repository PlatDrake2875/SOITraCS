# Ablation Study Configuration
# Tests individual and combined algorithm contributions to measure the
# importance of each component in the SOITCS system.
#
# Study Design:
# 1. Additive Ablation: Build up from CA-only baseline
# 2. Two-way Combinations: Test algorithm interactions
# 3. Full Stack: All algorithms enabled
# 4. Subtractive Ablation: Remove one algorithm at a time from full stack
